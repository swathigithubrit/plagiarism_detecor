This project is a Streamlit-based web app that analyzes text using NLP. It preprocesses the text, calculates perplexity using an N-gram language model, computes burstiness, and visualizes the most frequent and repeated words. Ideal for detecting AI-generated text and exploring word usage patterns. Built with Python, NLTK, and Matplotlib.
